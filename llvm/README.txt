A fork of LLVM with the intent of creating a functioning backend for the
Centurion "mini"computer and its cpu6 architecture.

Commits to this repository will attempt to follow the general outline
set by https://github.com/lowrisc/riscv-llvm, an INCREDIBLE
outline in the form of "ideal" commit logs that illustrate what is
requried to create a new llvm backend from nothing.
